## dotfiles
I don't know what I'm doing.

This doesn't include installing programs, look at [macos-setup](https://github.com/beanpuppy/macos-setup) for that.

## install
Network setup (repository not cloned):
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beanpuppy/dotfiles/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

Local setup (repository already cloned):
```bash
/bin/bash ~/dotfiles/bin/setup.sh
```
